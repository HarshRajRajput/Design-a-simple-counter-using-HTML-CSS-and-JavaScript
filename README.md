# Design-a-simple-counter-using-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript
A simple counter is a numeric display that increments or decrements based on user interaction. To design I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, create a display area and buttons. Use JavaScript to increment or decrement the counter value and update the display accordingly. The Range of the counting value is between -10 to 10.
